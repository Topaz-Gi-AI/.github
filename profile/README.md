## 🧠 Overview

**Topaz Gigapixel AI** is an advanced image enhancement tool designed to increase image resolution while preserving sharpness and detail. Using machine learning technology, it intelligently reconstructs missing pixels, producing clean and natural-looking results even at large scale factors.

Unlike traditional resizing methods, Gigapixel AI analyzes textures, edges, and patterns to generate high-quality enlargements without introducing blur or artifacts. This makes it especially useful for photographers, designers, and creators working with low-resolution or cropped images.

The software features a straightforward workflow that allows users to preview results in real time, compare different AI models, and fine-tune output settings. Optimized for Windows systems, it delivers fast processing and reliable performance on modern hardware.

Whether preparing images for print, restoring older photos, or enhancing digital artwork, Topaz Gigapixel AI provides a focused and efficient solution for high-quality image upscaling.
